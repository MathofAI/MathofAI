I am a master's student at TU Dresden, specializing in Computational Modeling and Simulation in Life Sciences. I also study at the CMC lab, focusing on exploring and replicating the brain's fascinating functions through computational methods. Currently, my research integrates machine learning with neuroscience, and I'm eager to explore further possibilities in the future.
