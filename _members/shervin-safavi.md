I'm a system and computational neuroscientist [in training]. I started my scientific journey from Physics, and after my undergrad in Physics I continued with neuroscience. I did my PhD in Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, in Logothetis lab with theme of establishing a bridge between different scales by exploting the cooperative neural activities. At the moment, I'm a post-doc in Peter Dayan's lab and doing computational pychiatry. Feel free to check my broader research here.
