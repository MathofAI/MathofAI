I'm a system and computational neuroscientist. I started my scientific journey from Physics, and after my undergrad in Physics (in University of Tehran) I continued with neuroscience. I did my PhD and postdoc in Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics and University of TÃ¼bingen, in the lab of Nikos Logothetis (for PhD) and Peter Dayan (for postdoc). I start CMC lab in TU Dresden from October 2023.
