I am Alireza, working as a Research Intern at CMC lab. My main interest is in the convergence of Machine Learning and neuroscience. I am also keen on applying and developing machine learning tools to make sense of neural data.

I am currently a medical doctor, having completed my education at Ahvaz University of Medical Sciences. These are my final days in the medical profession before I make a total career shift.
