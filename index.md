# CMC lab

**C**omputational **M**achinery of **C**ognition (CMC) lab is based at the [Medical Campus](https://tu-dresden.de/med/mf#) of  [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/). 
As the name of the lab suggests, we want to understand the computations that support our cognition, 
_and also_ the multi-scale machinery that implements these computations.
We closely collaborate with experimental and computational labs to develop new tools, computational models, and experimental paradigms to understand the computational machinery of cognition.
