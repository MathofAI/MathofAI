# Research

Here is the research stuff, that is being noted here! And even more! But not much! But also not too little

## Hybrid neural networks for cognitive neuroscience
Artificial neural network (ANN) have been influential for understanding the neural computations, 
however they suffer from biological plausibility. 
This is a key caveat when we want to use them to understand the computational machinery of cognitive process. 
We will exploit the  capacity of ANN for implementing different kinds of computations and hybrid them as much as possible with biological neural networks.
This will let us to have the goodness of both worlds.

Of course, it has to be Hello World, right?
