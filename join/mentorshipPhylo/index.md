# Lab's mentorship philosophy


CMC lab considers preparing the next generations of scientists, engineers,
clinicians, etc as one of my core responsibility to society as an
academic unit. Thus, we would love to contribute to both aspects of this
responsibility (training and mentoring the next generations).

Our mentorship is based on the following principles:

**Adaptive supervision:**
We believe the flexibility of the
lab PI is a key strength. Undergraduate and PhD students (and even
post-docs sometimes) perform their best under different forms of
supervision. For instance, some prefer step-by-step guidelines, some
rather prefer long-term plans and way more freedom on daily basis. 
Thus mentor and mentee, should identify together the most suitable supervision method.

**Scholarship beyond research:**
In our lab mentor should
provide manatees the training for all aspects of scholarship rather than
just research. That includes, for instance, peer-review, by involving
them in the peer-review processes, and particularly train them to
[criticize with
kindness](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/03/28/daniel-dennett-rapoport-rules-criticism/)
(Daniel Dennett's four steps of criticizing); Open scholarship and
reproducibility, and not just as a mandatory practice, but as valuable
action for science and society; and many more that lab  value in the
supervision.

**Lab's success is tied to success of the mentees:**
One of the most important criteria of academic success should be based on
judging the next generations they trained. This ranges from trivial
matters, such as publishing papers, to joining good labs as graduate
students and post-doc, to becoming a mature scientists and establishing
their own lab. Mentor should try her/his best on optimizing mentees
trajectory, thus s/he need to communicate timely and provide them
feedback (both positive and negative) frequently. Lastly, Mentor is also
responsible to help them to prepare for and plan the next stage of menteess'
career, by providing them timely hints on the critical action they need
to take according to their career stage.

**Metal health:**
Mental health of the lab
members should be one of the most important concern of the PI. Our lab PI (Shervin) had the chance to be one of the ombudspersons at the Max Planck Institute for Biological
Cybernetics for four years and also a PhD representative. These contributions taught him how critical is to care about mental health in academia. and how severe the lack of
accountability can affect students. Thus, it is the responsibility of the
lab PI to take any action needed to maintain a healthy lab. The
principles mentioned above are some of the key contributing factors, and
in addition to those, the following is also needed to maintain the
mental health of the lab: we need to normalize the failure (e.â€†g.,
rejection of a paper), we might frequently face such failures
in their academic career; we need to foster teamwork and collaboration
in the lab, not only because of the moral support it creates, but also
create multiple sources of success for members of the lab; lastly, lab PI, needs to make sure that the lab will remain sufficiently organized that allow smooth and stressless
workflow for all members.
