title: Master thesis on event-based analysis of large-scale dynamics
---

## Background

Neural events are characteristics, transient, coordinated, neural activities that we can identify in aggregated signals (e.g., local field potentials or LFPs). It has been shown some neural events have signatures across several scales (neurons, neural populations, and large-scale networks). Moreover, they are also closely connected to behavior; for instance, Sharp-Wave Ripples is one of the most studied neural events and, over two decades, it has been shown they are broadly involved in cognitive functions (from memory consolidation to offline and online planning).

## Project theme

We will use [CEBRA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06031-6) to explore the large-scale dynamics during these events.

## Skill we might need (N=necessary, D=desired, P=plus)

- (N) Have background (bachelor) in (computational) neuroscience, neuroscience, physics, mathematics, statistics, machine learning, psychology, and other related fields.
- (N) Familiarity with Python and MATLAB.
- (P) Being comfortable with programming (best would be, Python, and Matlab).
- (P) Have experience in the analysis of neurophysiology and fMRI data.
- (P) Familiarity with machine learning techniques or/and sufficient mathematical background.

## Learning targets

- Learn analysis of electrophysiology and fMRI data
- Learn neural data analysis techniques
- Learn topics in systems and computational neuroscience
