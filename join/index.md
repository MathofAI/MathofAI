# Join us


We are always excited about having new team members!

{% capture labPhyloAlert %}
Check [lab's mentorship philosophy]({{ site.baseurl }}/join/mentorshipPhylo) to get to know us better.

If you are interested in one of our open positions please proceed as instructed in the call; 
If you you interested in our research and would like to receive the open calls (for internship, master, PhD, and postdoc), please sign up with [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8V5Mu8d-JwZXjs_Ck5toLl0IBg5pTpTrZs4A_QW-71pi13A/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Please fill out this form at least with your name and email to get the future announcements. We will use project/call-specifc forms in the future, however, if you want, please feel free to fill the optional fields as well.

If you want to join the lab but there is no opening at the moment, or/and you have ideas and want to join the lab to realize it, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8V5Mu8d-JwZXjs_Ck5toLl0IBg5pTpTrZs4A_QW-71pi13A/viewform?usp=sf_link). 

{% capture formAlert %}
Forms provided in this page are more reliable than emails, and we try our best to process them as quick as possible, but if you we didn't get back to you within 4 weeks or so, please feel comfortable sending us a reminder (<tt>`applications at cmclab dot org`</tt>).

# Open positions
## PhD position
### Neural events
We have an opening for a PhD student for analysis of neural events. Please check [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/join/bne_phd_202310) for more details on theme of the research question, and [here](https://www.uniklinikum-dresden.de/de/jobs-und-karriere/stellenangebote/wissenschaft/phd-position-m-f-x) for the official advertisement.

## Master thesis projects

There are multiple master thesis project in the lab, 
we'll try to keep an updated list below.
If you are interested please fill [this form](https://forms.gle/wGbSMoEdqBXBtaG3A), and select the corresponding project code. 
For most of the projects, more description is also provided in link associated to the 
project code.
If that doesn't help and you need further information please get in touch with the contact person (forth column), otherwise filling the [application form](https://forms.gle/wGbSMoEdqBXBtaG3A) is enough and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
To help you connect these projects to the global research of the lab, in the third column we provide the keywords of corresponding research program in our [research](/research) page, and the associated links give you the most relevant paper of the lab in those domains.

We also regularly announce potential master thesis project for people who expressed interest through our [CMC interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8V5Mu8d-JwZXjs_Ck5toLl0IBg5pTpTrZs4A_QW-71pi13A/viewform?usp=sf_link). 
If you are interested you can sign up there.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been tremendously helpful for understanding the dynamics underlying neural computations. 
One limiting factor of RNNs for understanding the brain circuits, 
is their weak connection with more biologically plausible networks. 
In this project we explore how we can relate the dynamics of RNN to their counterparts in more plausible biological neural networks.
