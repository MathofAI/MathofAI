# Join us


We are always excited about having new team members!

{% capture labPhyloAlert %}
Check [lab's mentorship philosophy]({{ site.baseurl }}/join/mentorshipPhylo) to get to know us better.

If you are interested in one of our open positions please proceed as instructed in the call; 
If you you interested in our research and would like to receive the open calls (for internship, master, PhD, and postdoc), please sign up with [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8V5Mu8d-JwZXjs_Ck5toLl0IBg5pTpTrZs4A_QW-71pi13A/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Please fill out this form at least with your name and email to get the future announcements. We will use project/call-specifc forms in the future, however, if you want, please feel free to fill the optional fields as well.

If you want to join the lab but there is no opening at the moment, or/and you have ideas and want to join the lab to realize it, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8V5Mu8d-JwZXjs_Ck5toLl0IBg5pTpTrZs4A_QW-71pi13A/viewform?usp=sf_link). 

{% capture formAlert %}
Forms provided in this page are more reliable than emails, and we try our best to process them as quick as possible, but if you we didn't get back to you within 4 weeks or so, please feel comfortable sending us a reminder (<tt>`applications at cmclab dot org`</tt>).

# Open positions
## PhD position
### Neural events
We have an opening for a PhD student for analysis of neural events. Please check [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/join/bne_phd_202310) for more details on theme of the research question, and here for the official advertisement.

## Master thesis projects

There are multiple master thesis project in the lab, a subset of them are outlined in the table below. 
If you are interested please fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8V5Mu8d-JwZXjs_Ck5toLl0IBg5pTpTrZs4A_QW-71pi13A/viewform?usp=sf_link), and select the corresponding project code. 
For some of the projects, a bit more description is also provided as link to the project code.
If that doesn't help and you need further information please get in touch with the contact person (third column), otherwise filling the [application form](https://forms.gle/z2uxZ8Cr2nzKVWFk8) is enough and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Neural events are characteristics, transient, coordinated, neural activities that we can identify them in aggregated signals (e.g., local field potentials or LFPs). 
Fascinating aspect of neural events is their multi-scale signatures, and their behavioral relevance.
For instance Sharp-Wave Ripples is one of the most studied neural events and, it has been shown they are broadly involved in cognitive functions (from memory consolidation to  planning). 
	In collaboration with experimental labs (e.g., [Oliva-Fernandez-Ruiz lab](https://braincomputation.org/) in Cornell) we will explore different events and their behavioral signatures.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been tremendously helpful for understanding the dynamics underlying neural computations. 
One limiting factor of RNNs for understanding the brain circuits, 
is their weak connection with more biologically plausible networks. 
In this project we explore how we can relate the dynamics of RNN to their counterparts in more plausible biological neural networks.

We also regularly announce potential master thesis project for people who expressed interest through our [CMC interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8V5Mu8d-JwZXjs_Ck5toLl0IBg5pTpTrZs4A_QW-71pi13A/viewform?usp=sf_link). 
If you are interested you can sign up there.
